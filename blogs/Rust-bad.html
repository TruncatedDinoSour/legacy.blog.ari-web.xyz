                    >Update: Rust's memory safety is good, but I still think the
                    binary size, compile times and everything else is STILL not
                    worth it</i
                >
                <p>
                    Ah yes, memory safety, the only thing people use bruhst for,
                    like it's so important to them, first up if you're
                    allocating a lot of memory you shouldn't be programming
                    either way, allocating memory is slow and heavy so you
                    should not do it if you can get away of not doing it, like
                    ofc it's necessary to allocate memory in
                    <strong> some cases </strong>
                    , but to unnecessarily allocate it and FORGET TO FREE IT is
                    just on you...
                </p>
            </strike>
            <h2>Rust is painful to compile</h2>
            <p>
                Rust is horribly heavy and slow to compile so if people start
                writing software only in rust it will become a mess for users
                who compile their software and it's already happening for me for
                example, I'm on gentoo and every time I compile rust I just want
                to kill myself because of how painful and slow it is. Just
                bad...
            </p>
            <strike>
                <h2>Less availability (Update: Getting better)</h2>
                <i
                    >Update: It's getting better, though the binary size is
                    nowhere near good</i
                >
                <p>
                    Rust binaries are slower and larger so making the
                    availability to people bad. And for people who have lower
                    spec computers and they still compile everything this will
                    also make the compiling process painful so they might give
                    up and not use your software, again making your software
                    less available to less people. Even though it can make the
                    development builds faster, at the end it's the end user
                    who's experience is more important.

                <h2>Horrible ass syntax (Update: This is very subjective)</h2>
                <i
                    >Update: I personally think its syntax is bad, but I should
                    not have put this here as it is very subjective, a lot of
                    people seem to like its syntax</i
                >
                <p>
                    Rust's syntax is horrible and not a lot of developers know
                    it and not a lot of jobs require it, so learning rust is
                    just torturing with the weird ass, shit(tm)++ syntax:

                    I wanted to exaggerate, but this actually feels and looks a
                    bit like rust code LOL... Even though this also resembles
                    C++ a bit, C++ is not as horrible as this.

                >
                <p>
                    Even though rust has come a good way since like two years
                    back it's still buggy and for production you can kinda
                    expect it to break in one way or another.
                </p>
                <h2>In some ways, bad debugging experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Disassembling rust binaries is a pain, so you lose some
                    privilege to debugging rust code, though that's just my
                    experience, complete mess...
                </p>
            </strike>
            <h2>Rust causes bloated software</h2>
            <p>
                Rust projects usually require 3908948093 crates, even the
                simplest projects require a lot of them so rust executables
                become large and painful to compile quick. Rust dependencies
                also are a pain to manage and you just get a
                LARGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE cargo.toml file so again making
                it a pain to download for people with worse hardware, shit
                internet and/or low storage.
            </p>
            <h2>Rust has a bad community</h2>
            <p>
                Rust's community consists of idiots calling C cringe, unsafe,
                slow and in general bad and people who complain about CMake
                causing C software to be bloated when it's nowhere near as
                bloated as cargo and in general rust. Sure they have good docs,
                but that's everything good about it...
            </p>
            <p>
                Every project includes at least one rocket emoji and description
                is something like "XXX is a blazingly fast, configurable,
                lightweight #rustrewrite, it introduces 69 new features and it's
                very very fast trust me"
            </p>
            <h2>More downsides than upsides</h2>
            <p>
                People call rust good because it's modern and has useless memory
                safety when overlooking other flaws I mentioned before for
                example being bloated, less available and being slow to compile,
                making rust ultimately <strike>useless</strike> bad
            </p>

            <h2>Bad library support</h2>
            <p>
                Even though rust has a bunch of libraries, it's missing a lot of
                them and doing everything from scratch is a pain. Its libraries
                suck a lot and most that are out there are buggy.
            </p>
            <strike>
                <h2>Bad IDE support (Update: Getting better)</h2>
                <i
                    >Update: More and more editors are supporting rust, some are
                    even written in rust</i
                >
                <p>
                    Rust with its popularity is getting more editing support,
                    but either way on a bunch of editors rust is not supported
                    as language.

            <h2>Overly backed by companies</h2>
            <p>
                I don't like companies and they usually ruin everything, I see
                rust's future as a pile of garbage...

            <hr />
            <p>
                Now, rust community, I know y'all don't like me, but please, I
                know you're reading this, explain to me why rust is so good,
                make an issue on github or something. I keep asking y'all and
                y'all just keep ignoring me which is kinda stupid when you are
                trying to prove a point.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>And some points y'all pointed out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Ah yes, memory safety, such useless thing" (sarcasticly) [Valid-ish]
                </li>
                <li>"Bad syntax, lisp totally does it better"</li> [Subjectively, yes]
                <li>
                    "Obviously we call rust good because of memory safety and
                    modernism" [Yeah]
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <i
                >Update: That is not how memory safety works... Most issues are
                overflow and underflow issues you can only detect at
                runtime...</i
            >
            <strike>
            <p>
                To debunk stuff y'all said. Memeory safety being useless is true
                imo, most projects are not some high scale enterprise apps which
                are stupidly made by allocating memory left and right (Update: not how memory safety works) and it
                being not closely monitored. and the ones which are lower-scale
                usually don't allocate a bunch of memory always and not free it,
                but if they do, just to make sure, memory safety is good. A lot
                of people seem to think that when programming in C you have to
                code like mallocing memory for everything all the time (true, a lot of people think that). And bad
                syntax, yes, its syntax is bad worse than C++ (subjective), I can't believe
                how badly designed it is. And again, yes, you call it good
                because of those things while ignoring all the downsides of it,
                you just want to be "a part of a trend" (some people actually need it (?)) and overly focused on
                modernism (a lot of people are).
