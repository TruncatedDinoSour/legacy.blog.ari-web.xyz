      <p>FOSS hardware should be a thing.</p>
      <h2>Intel ME and AMD PSP</h2>
      <p>
        Intel and AMD are pretty popular
        <strong> companies </strong>
        and so like most companies they're evil. For example
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">
          Intel ME
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor">
          AMD PSP
        </a>
        , they're basically low-level spyware, and not like you can easily
        disable it. Normal users won't be able to do it properly and even
        experienced computer nerds too, it's really finicky and I only saw few
        people on the internet do it, well at least for Intel.
      </p>
      <p>As far as I'm aware for Intel CPUs you have to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Patch the BIOS</li>
        <li>Patch the firmware</li>
        <li>Physically modify the CPU</li>
        <li>Configure the BIOS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And for AMD it's a bit easier</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Patch the firmware</li>
        <li>Patch the BIOS</li>
        <li>Configure the BIOS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both Intel ME and AMD PSP have LOADS of CVEs, the ironic thing is that
        they're supposed to be secure...
      </p>
      <p>
        They are terrible, just built in CVEs and spyware, not even open source.
        It's all proprietary... They use
        <a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/security-through-obscurity">
          security through obscurity
        </a>
        which has never ended well...
      </p>
      <h2>FOSS hardware</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What do I even mean by "FOSS hardware"?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Open source firmware, drivers, BIOS, etc.</li>
        <li>All scheming and build process FOSS too.</li>
        <li>All plans completely open.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Etc.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>FOSS hardware.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Now after reading this you probably now understand why I want FOSS
        hardware. There's no real alternatives to Intel and AMD spyware so we
        have to deal with it, so FOSS hardware would
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make FOSS more popular and give FOSS operating systems hardware they
          need
        </li>
        <li>Would not have as many CVEs and in general insecurities</li>
        <li>Would have less issues on for example BSD and Linux</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Like imagine having probably no issues on FOSS operating systems and not
        needing to live in a world where EVERYTHING you do is spied on you on a
        very low, hardware, level.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In general FOSS</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As I see Linux growing more and more I feel like the next logical step
        is FOSS hardware, Linux lacks that a bit, it would be amazing to have
        something that you can trust and see what it does on every level.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>To conclude</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          AMD and Intel are weird and just as bad as any other companies known
          for their spyware, just that Intel ME and AMD PSP is not as talked
          about
        </p>
