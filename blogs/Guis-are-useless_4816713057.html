        GUIs are useless. They are usually an unnecessary abstraction over
        simple things. Not even a lightweight one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take for example DMs (display managers), they are just a bloated,
        useless and annoying abstractions over a simple TTY login. They don't
        even have proper logging or error reporting and you get no TTY or just a
        shell to debug in, you just get logged out with no logs, error reporting
        nor a shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most things you do in a GUIs is easily achieved in the CLI, like idk,
        managing files. With a GUI it's more complicated, for example in a GUI:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open file manager</li>
        <li>Find the path</li>
        <li>Find the correct icon</li>
        <li>Select icon</li>
        <li>Drag icon to folder1</li>
        <li>Check you didn't mess up by trying to find the icon again</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While with the CLI you can just:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code> mv file1 folder1 </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> ls file1 </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        GUIs are not easier in any way, they are useless, bloated garbage which
        is unnecessary for
        <em> most </em>
        things
      </p>
      <p>
        CLI is also much much much smaller, less complicated and more
        lightweight, where GUIs are not. And now on the topic of being
        lightweight, why are GUIs so heavy??? They're supposed to be just simple
        abstractions over the CLI and not computer 823284327942th number of the
        Fibonacci sequence every second.
      </p>
      <p>
        GUIs are unnecessary as hell, that's why my goal is to go full TTY, but
        I still haven't found a good solution to firefox for example.
